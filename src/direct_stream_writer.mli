(** Like [Rpc.Pipe_rpc.Direct_stream_writer.Group], but with the ability to maintain
    multiple subgroups.  One [Rpc.Pipe_rpc.Direct_stream_writer.Group] is maintained per
    implemented RPC, so values are only converted and serialized once per RPC.

    Since values are only converted once, the functions passed to
    [Babel.Callee.Pipe_rpc_direct.{filter_,}map_response] must be pure, or unexpected
    results can occur.  To determine whether two direct stream writers can be combined,
    [Direct_stream_writer.t] contains a type id for the output type, and a unique
    [Transformation_id] that is intended to uniquely identify the conversion function from
    the input type to the output type.

    Because the library has no way of automatically identifying whether two ['a
    Direct_stream_writer.t]'s with output type ['b] have the same conversion function ['a
    -> 'b option], users must promise that the [Transformation_id.t] is never re-used with
    a different function.  To take advantage of the grouping, the [Expert] functions above
    must be used to create the writer.  Using the non expert writers will result in
    a direct stream writer which cannot be combined and will be put in its own group.
    [Babel.Callee.Pipe_rpc_direct.{filter_,}map_response] use the [Expert] functions so they
    can be combined. *)

      automatically send a copy of the last value written to each new writer when it's
      added to the group. It's split out as a separate function from [create] as it's not
      safe to re-use a buffer between multiple different groups in this case, as the
      previous value is stored in the buffer. *)
  val create_storing_last_value_and_sending_on_add : unit -> _ t

  (** Add a direct stream writer to the group. Raises if
      [Rpc.Pipe_rpc.Direct_stream_writer.Group.add_exn] would raise. If
      [create_storing_last_value_and_sending_on_add] was used to create the group,
      [add_exn] will additionally write the stored last value to the writer. This will
      only involve conversion and serialization if the new writer uses a different
      protocol than the other writers in the group. *)
